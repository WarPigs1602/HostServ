# HostServ
 This is the HostServ, currently configured for newserv. 
 
 It's recommened to use the forked [snircd](https://github.com/WarPigs1602/snircd), because in the original snircd is an issue with the user mode +h and doesn't G-Line setted hosts.
 
 It hides the hosts for all users in your irc network :)

 It's recommened to compile the sources with NetBeans

 As an alternative can you download a precompiled package [HostServ.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18314365/HostServ.zip).
 To run this service, you must use postgresql and jre17 or higher.
