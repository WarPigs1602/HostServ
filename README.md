# HostServ
 This is the HostServ for [snircd](https://github.com/WarPigs1602/snircd).
 
 It hides the hosts for all users in your irc network :)

 It's recommened to compile the sources with NetBeans

 As an alternative can you download a precompiled package [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18288350/HostServ.zip) and the jre17 or higher is needed.
